# Viromics_Vigo (IIM-CSIC)
This repo contains the material we will employ during the Viromics day (thursday, October24th: 9-14h).
During this session we will work with Apostichopus japonicus (*Japanese sea cucumber*), a non-model organism. But we are lucky. It's genome is already sequenced and deposited al the NCBI with Chromosome Assembly level (GCA_037975245.1:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_037975245.1/).
