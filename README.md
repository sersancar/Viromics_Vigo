# Viromics_Vigo (IIM-CSIC)
This repo contains the material we will employ during the Viromics day (thursday, October 24: 9-14h).

During this session we will work with *Apostichopus japonicus* (sea cucumber), a non-model organism. But we are lucky. It's genome is already sequenced and deposited al the NCBI with Chromosome Assembly level (GCA_037975245.1: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_037975245.1/).

Our sea cucumber is not only an elegant echinoderm, but also a valuable dish, especially in China, Korea and Japan. Many tonnes of this sea cucumber are caught every year and it is also farmed on a commercial scale. When cultivated, sea cucumbers are fed on a diet consisting mainly of seaweed and sometimes suffer from diseases related to eating disorders.

In this 'hands on' activity we will try to investigate the ecological role played by viruses in the gut microbiome of sea cucumbers. Viruses are known to limit the host population they parasitise and also drive the evolution of their hosts through horizontal gene transfer and the expression of viral auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). These AMGs are host genes that viruses carry in their genomes to enhance specific metabolic pathways, providing an evolutionary advantage to the hosts.
